# UNIT-2-pro-portfolio

For this weeks homework, the task at hand was to create a professional portfolio showcasing my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. I aimed to highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

The idea behind this, is that students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

## Creation process

For this task i used HTML to create the foundations of the website and CSS add colours and create a layout.
